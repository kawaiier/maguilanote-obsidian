![Maguilanote Logo](https://github.com/is-cout/maguilanote-obsidian/blob/main/logo.png)

A Milanote-style visual workspace for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md): notes, images, links, files, columns, to-do lists, color swatches, comments, audio recordings, nested boards and arrows on an infinite canvas, entirely inside your vault.

**Local-first by design.** Each board is a single `.board` JSON file in your vault. There's no account, no server, and no real-time collaboration; sync your vault however you already do (Obsidian Sync, Git, Syncthing, a shared folder...). Cloud collaboration is out of scope for this project, not a missing feature.

## Features

**Boards**
- Infinite canvas, nested boards with breadcrumb, board-to-board shortcuts
- Broken-link detection, card previews, item locking, move/duplicate across boards
- Built-in and custom templates

**Card types**
- Text note, image, link (auto title, YouTube embed), file (any type, audio/video player)
- Vault file drag & drop, to-do list, column, color swatch, comment, document note
- Record: drag onto the board, double-click to open the recording popup (pick a microphone, record, play back); the card's contextual toolbar → "Transcribe text" sends it to the OpenAI Whisper API (requires an API key in Settings) and drops the result into a connected note card

**Drawing**
- Draw: freehand on the board (pen/select/eraser, color, stroke size, pen-pressure), strokes grouped into editable drawings on save
- Sketch: a card you draw inside via a popup canvas; shows a preview on the board

**Connections**
- Line tool: drag it onto the board, then drag either endpoint onto a card to anchor it (or leave it free)
- Card-hover blue dot: drag to another card to draw an arrow (drop on empty canvas for a free end)
- Two routing modes, switchable per line from its right-click menu: **Free** (straight, drag its middle dot to curve it) and **Smart** (auto-routed around cards)
- Arrows, solid/dashed, arrowhead toggle, reversible, labels, color
- Rubber-band select works on lines too (any part touching the selection box is selected); Delete removes selected lines

**Text editing**
- Full Markdown: headings, bold/italic/strikethrough, lists, quotes, code, links, `[[wikilinks]]`
- Card background colors, plus an independent accent color (left-side stripe)

**Contextual toolbar**
- Selecting a card opens its options in the same lateral slot used by the Draw toolbar: card color, accent color, show/hide title, and type-specific actions (replace reference, transcribe recording)
- Right-click keeps only structural actions: lock/unlock, duplicate, bring to front/back, delete

**Canvas**
- Select/drag, multi-select, group move, resize
- Alt+drag duplicate, snap-to-grid, undo/redo, cut/copy/paste
- Zoom controls (wheel on desktop; pinch and two-finger pan on touch devices)

**Settings**
- Gear icon next to the breadcrumb trail opens the Settings panel
- Customization: separate body/heading fonts (pick a preset or any Google Font by name), dark/light theme, and per-theme colors (board background, default card background, each card color preset)
- Shortcuts: rebind any keyboard shortcut (click to record, reset to default), plus a collapsible mouse/gesture reference

**Search & export**
- In-board search, export to Markdown or JSON Canvas, import JSON Canvas and OS/vault files

**Collaboration**
- Local comment cards, unlimited local storage (it's your disk)

## Manual installation

1. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` to `YOUR_VAULT/.obsidian/plugins/maguilanote/`.
2. In Obsidian → Settings → Community plugins, enable **Maguilanote**.

## Usage

- The ribbon icon or the **"Maguilanote: New board"** command creates a `.board` file.
- **Double-click the board's name in the breadcrumb trail to rename it** — Markdown links and nested-board references across your vault update automatically.
- Double-click the canvas to create a note. On iPad, use one finger to pan, Apple Pencil to manipulate cards, pinch or two fingers to zoom/pan, and long-press a card for its context menu. The left toolbar adds every other card type — **drag** a tool onto the canvas to create it where you drop it (a plain click on a drag-only tool just shakes it as a hint). Draw is the exception: click it (or press `D`) to enter draw mode; touch is ignored while Pencil draws.
- Click a card to select it; drag to move. Inputs inside a card only activate once it is selected. Double-click to edit/open.
- Drag files from the OS or from Obsidian's file explorer straight onto the board (`.board` files become nested boards).
- Alt+drag duplicates. The bottom bar has zoom controls, 1:1, fit, and a snap-to-grid toggle (Ctrl while dragging inverts snap).
- Click the gear icon next to the breadcrumb trail to open Settings (fonts, theme, colors, shortcuts).

## Building from source

With npm available:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Without npm (Node 22+ only):

```
node build-local.mjs
```

Both produce `main.js` at the project root. See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for details.

## Documentation

This README covers the essentials. For everything else, see [`docs/`](docs/):

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — how the plugin is built: source layout, data model, rendering and build pipeline.
- [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) — full dev setup, build commands, verification checklist.
- [IPAD-TEST-MATRIX.md](docs/IPAD-TEST-MATRIX.md) — real-device touch and Apple Pencil verification matrix.
- [DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md) — dependency pinning policy and current versions.
- [FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md) — "how do I change X" answers (colors, defaults, card types, shortcuts, and more).
- [CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) — living log of significant project changes.

Docs are a living part of this project: significant changes must update the relevant doc and get a changelog entry in the same change, not as a follow-up. See the documentation policy in [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md).
