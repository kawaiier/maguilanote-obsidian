# Architecture

Technical overview of how the Maguilanote plugin is built. Read this before making non-trivial changes.

## Overview

Maguilanote is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that registers a custom file type, `.board`, and renders it as an infinite canvas instead of Markdown text. Each `.board` file is a plain JSON document. There is no server, no account, and no sync layer of its own — persistence is just "write JSON to a vault file," so it works with whatever sync method the vault already uses (Obsidian Sync, Git, Syncthing, a shared folder, etc.).

## Source layout

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/main.ts` | Plugin entry point. Registers the `.board` extension and the `BoardView`, adds ribbon icon/commands (new board, export to Markdown), owns plugin settings (grid snap, grid size, default note width, templates folder, assets folder, font, theme, per-theme colors, keybindings), the cross-board clipboard, and the board rename flow (`renameBoard` + a vault `rename` listener that repairs nested-board references and breadcrumb trails Obsidian's link updater can't see). |
| `src/types.ts` | Shared data model: `Item`, `Edge`, `BoardData`, card color palette (`CARD_COLORS`), file-extension lists used to classify dropped files, `parseBoard` (JSON → `BoardData`, tolerant of malformed/empty files), and the rebindable-shortcut model (`ShortcutActionId`, `KeyBinding`, `DEFAULT_KEYBINDINGS`, `matchesBinding`). |
| `src/board-view.ts` | Implements `BoardView extends TextFileView` — the `TextFileView` lifecycle, DOM construction (`onOpen`), rendering entry points (`render`, `drawEdges`, `rerenderItem`), and a handful of small always-together methods (`renderCrumbs`, `applyAppearance`/`defaultStrokeColor`, `onDblClick`/`openCard`/`editNote`). Every other concern used to live here too; it's now split into the single-responsibility modules below, each exporting `function name(view: BoardView, ...)` functions that `BoardView` delegates to by method of the same name (mirrors the `render.ts` convention). |
| `src/board-history.ts` | Undo/redo history stack: `commit`, `undo`, `redo`. |
| `src/board-camera.ts` | Pan/zoom/viewport transforms: `applyTransform`, `screenToWorld`, `viewCenter`, `setZoom`, `zoomToFit`, `centerOn`, `cardWorldRects`, `onWheel`. |
| `src/board-interaction.ts` | The pointer/drag state machine: `DragMode` type, `onPointerDown`/`onPointerMove`/`onPointerUp`, card/column hit-testing and highlighting, selection-class refresh, in-place cloning (Alt+drag). |
| `src/board-item-crud.ts` | Creating items: `addItem` and the per-type `addNote`/`addTodo`/`addColumn`/... helpers, `createFromTool` (toolbar drag-drop dispatch), link/board prompts, vault-file placement. |
| `src/board-clipboard.ts` | Cut/copy/paste/duplicate/delete of the current selection. |
| `src/board-context-menu.ts` | Right-click menu for cards and edges (color, lock, duplicate, z-order, delete, transcribe). |
| `src/board-keyboard.ts` | Global keyboard shortcut dispatch (`onKeyDown`), driven by the user's configured `keybindings`. |
| `src/board-drop-import.ts` | Drag-and-drop and paste import: OS files, Obsidian file-explorer drags, toolbar tool drops, pasted text/links. |
| `src/drawing-toolbar.ts` | Board Draw mode and the Sketch card popup: the shared contextual toolbar (`ContextToolbar` wiring), color/size pickers, `DRAW_SWATCHES`, `enterDrawMode`/`exitDrawMode`, `addSketch`/`openSketchPopup`. |
| `src/record-card.ts` | Record card popup: microphone selection, recording via `MediaRecorder`, live volume meter, and Whisper transcription (`openRecordPopup`, `transcribeRecord`). |
| `src/file-preview.ts` | Inline preview overlay for vault-file/image/board cards and broken-reference relinking (`openPreviewFor`, `relinkItem`, `closePreview`). |
| `src/board-search.ts` | In-board text search (`openSearch`, `closeSearch`, `runSearch`). |
| `src/geometry.ts` | Small standalone geometry helper: `segmentIntersectsRect` (rubber-band selection hit-testing against lines). |
| `src/render.ts` | Pure(ish) rendering helpers: builds the DOM for each card type (note, image, link, file, column, todo, swatch, comment, board, drawing, sketch, record) and draws SVG edges between cards. Kept separate from `board-view.ts` so card markup doesn't get tangled with interaction/state logic. |
| `src/draw.ts` | Freehand drawing engine, shared by board Draw mode and the Sketch card popup. Exports `ContextToolbar` (reusable contextual-toolbar base), `DrawSession` (pen/select/eraser + local undo/redo over an SVG surface, using `perfect-freehand` for stroke outlines), `strokeToPath`/`strokesBBox` (stroke → SVG, reused by `render.ts`), and `groupStrokes` (proximity clustering used on Draw save). |
| `src/modals.ts` | Small reusable Obsidian modals: text prompt, vault file picker, and `SettingsModal` (Customization + Shortcuts panel, opened from the gear icon next to the breadcrumb trail). |
| `src/styles/*.css` | The stylesheet, authored as partials by section (`variables`, `layout`, `cards`, `edges`, `chrome`, `preview`, `drawing`) and imported by `src/styles/index.css`. Bundled by esbuild into the root `styles.css`, which is now a build artifact — don't hand-edit it. |

## Data model

A board file is:

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "items": [ /* Item[] — notes, images, links, files, columns, todos, swatches, comments, nested boards */ ],
  "edges": [ /* Edge[] — arrows/lines; each end is an item id (from/to) or a free world point (fromPt/toPt) */ ]
}
```

An `Edge` connects two endpoints. Each end is **either** anchored to an item (`from`/`to` = item id) **or** free-floating (`fromPt`/`toPt` = `{x, y}` world point). A line dropped from the toolbar starts with both ends free; dragging an endpoint handle onto a card anchors that end. Optional `label`, `arrow`, `dashed`, `color` control appearance.

`mode` selects the routing style: `"free"` (default for new lines) draws a straight segment clipped to each end's boundary, optionally bowed into a curve through `bend` (a `{x, y}` world point, dragged from the line's midpoint handle); `"smart"` uses the older auto-routed bezier that picks a side per card and bends around it. A missing `mode` is treated as `"smart"` so boards saved before this field existed keep their original look.

`Item.type` is one of: `note`, `image`, `link`, `file`, `column`, `todo`, `swatch`, `comment`, `board`, `drawing`, `sketch`, `record` (see `ItemType` in `src/types.ts`). Every item has a position (`x`, `y`), width (`w`) and optional manual height (`h`); content that grows taller than `h` is never clipped. Items can be nested inside a `column` item via `parent` + `order`.

`drawing` and `sketch` items carry a `strokes: Stroke[]` field. A `Stroke` is `{ points: number[][], color, size }` where each point is `[x, y, pressure]` in **item-local** coordinates (relative to the item's `x`/`y`), so moving the card needs no point rewrite. `drawing` items are produced by Draw mode (transparent, sized to their strokes); `sketch` items are drawn inside a fixed popup canvas and render a scaled preview on the card.

Nested boards are just `board`-type items whose `path` points at another `.board` file in the vault — there's no separate "project" concept, a board **is** the file.

`record` items hold an audio clip: `path` points at a `.webm` file recorded via `getUserMedia`/`MediaRecorder` and saved into the board's `assets/` folder (a helper local to `src/record-card.ts`, `saveAssetBinary`, used the same way for pasted/dropped OS files), and `duration` (seconds) is informational only. An empty `record` item (no `path` yet) renders a "Double-click to record" placeholder; double-click opens `record-card.ts`'s `openRecordPopup`, which lists input devices via `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`, pre-selecting `MaguilanoteSettings.defaultMicId`, and shows a live volume meter via a Web Audio `AnalyserNode`. Once a recording exists, its right-click menu gets a "Transcribe text" item (`record-card.ts`'s `transcribeRecord`) that posts the audio to the OpenAI Whisper API using `MaguilanotePlugin.getOpenAiApiKey()` and creates a connected `note` item with the result — the only feature in the plugin that calls an external network service, and only on explicit user action with a user-supplied key. On desktop that key is stored outside the vault entirely (`src/secrets.ts`, `~/.maguilanote/secrets.json`) so it isn't swept into vault backups; on mobile (no filesystem access outside the vault) it falls back to `MaguilanoteSettings.openaiApiKey` in `data.json`.

## Rendering pipeline

1. `BoardView.onLoadFile` reads the file, calls `parseBoard`, stores `BoardData` in memory.
2. For each item, `render.ts`'s `renderCardFn` builds the card DOM based on `item.type`.
3. `drawEdgesFn` draws an SVG overlay for arrows/lines, positioned relative to the current pan/zoom transform.
4. User interactions (drag, resize, edit) mutate the in-memory `BoardData`, then `BoardView` schedules a save (`TextFileView.requestSave`), which serializes back to JSON.

## Build pipeline

- TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`) type-checks `src/**/*.ts` (`tsc -noEmit`) — no `.js` is emitted by `tsc` itself.
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) (`esbuild.config.mjs`) bundles `src/main.ts` into a single CommonJS `main.js`, externalizing `obsidian`, `electron`, CodeMirror/Lezer packages (provided by the Obsidian host at runtime) and Node builtins.
- A second esbuild step bundles `src/styles/index.css` (which `@import`s the partials in `src/styles/`) into the root `styles.css` — the file Obsidian actually loads. The root `styles.css` is generated; edit the partials under `src/styles/` instead.
- `manifest.json` + `versions.json` follow the standard Obsidian plugin conventions (`minAppVersion` compatibility map).

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for how to actually run the build.

## Why no cloud/collaboration layer

This is a deliberate scope decision, not a missing feature: the plugin is local-first by design. All state lives in a single JSON file inside the user's own vault. Real-time multi-user editing, hosted sharing links, and account-based sync are explicitly out of scope — see the "Collaboration & cloud" section in the README's feature list.
